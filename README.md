# P04-Access-Control-System
In this assignment, we are going to develop a simple “access control” program. We use a
program much like this one (although more complex) to maintain access to the shared computers
in the instructional lab.
An access control system maintains a record of valid users and their properties. In order to
gain access to the machine, a user must accurately report their matching name and password.
The goals of this assignment include:
• Practice creating your own instantiable classes and using objects.
• Practice using java.util.ArrayList class.
• Get more practice with exception handling and writing tester methods.
The source code can be found in the 'P04/src' directory.
